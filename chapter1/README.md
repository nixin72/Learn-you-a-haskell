## Chapter 1

What I gathered:

- Haskell is a purely functional programming language
  - No side-effects
  - No mutation
  - Everything is a pipeline of function calls
- Haskell has lazy evaluation for function
  - Will only evaluate a function when you need it
  - Allows haskell to only iterate over a list once when doing something like mapping
- Haskell is statically typed
  - It has really strong type inference
  - You don't need to specify types because the compiler can figure it out
